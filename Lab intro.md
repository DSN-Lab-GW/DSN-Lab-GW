Developmental Social Neuroscience Lab

The Developmental Social Neuroscience lab investigates physiological, behavioral, and neural mechanisms underlying social decisions and learning in childhood and adolescence. Our particular focus is on neurodevelopmental disorders, so we compare social learning in typically developing (TD) kids and kids with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To unravel the neurobiological mechanisms underlying learning and decision making, our research projects combine behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and neuroimaging.

Our work is supported by the Simons Foundation for Autism Research (SFARI) and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).
